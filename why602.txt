I'm interested in the course "Principles of Data Science" because it will help me understand how to work with data and find useful insights.
It will improve my ability to analyze data, make predictions, and solve real-world problems. 
Learning these concepts is important for my career as a data analyst and will keep me updated with industry trends.
